## Informed Consent Workshop

The most common complaint we hear in trainings is "Why isn't my manager in this class?"  At least
one third of the challenges that participants raise in training are things we'd like management's
help with.

The best adoptions we've been involved with were both _top down_ and _bottom up_.

WARNING: Broad adaptiveness is a greater opportunity -- and greater challenge -- for the entire organization than training sponsors
realize at first.
{: .notice--danger}

The informed consent workshop is a get together with a cross section of senior management, HR, 
developers, and intermediate managers (e.g. program managers, project managers, department heads). 
We will discuss current pain points, what's gone wrong with previous improvement initiatives, what
pitfalls and setbacks are likely ... all the icky stuff. Bring samples of your source code if you
like.  Please be prepared to discuss what you want to optimize your organization for, what you
want to keep, and what you think your organization must give up to move toward that optimization goal.

## (Team) Sprint Retrospective Facilitation

Whether your methods are influenced by Scrum, Kanban, XP, waterfall, LeSS, or all/none of the above, 
we want teams to *own* their processes and methods, not *rent* them.

An effective retrospective -- one that leads to shared understanding and durable agreements -- allows
sufficient discussion of objective questions, reflective questions, introspective questions before
moving into decisional questions (ORID).  An effective facilitator is a skillful listener who creates 
space for viewpoints from the entire group, not only the most confident.

According to [Roger Schwarz](https://www.amazon.com/Skilled-Facilitator-Comprehensive-Consultants-Facilitators/dp/0787947237), a facilitator should be

1. acceptable to all members of the group,
1. substantively neutral, and
1. not have substantive decision making authority.

Schwarz writes that _the facilitator can meet these three criteria only if he or she is not a group member_.

While we would like you to eventually develop facilitation capabilities internally (e.g. with 
your own Scrum Masters), in the
beginning or at crucial times it can be better to enlist outside help.  This is a cost-effective
option for situations that do not need a full-time coach.

## Overall Retrospective Facilitation

When more than one team works on a product, they are more likely to develop a _whole product view_ by following their
separate (Team) Sprint Retrospectives with a cross-team
[Overall Retrospective](https://less.works/less/framework/overall-retrospective.html). This is for team members
(or representative samples of them), Scrum Masters, the Product Owner, and management to inspect and adapt the
entire product development system. A neutral outsider can use systems modeling, causal loop diagramming, and 
large group facilitation techniques to help make these discussions productive.

## Product Backlog Refinement (aka. Backlog Grooming) Facilitation

Organizations struggle to capture user needs in their product backlogs in ways that
lend themselves to adaptability, reduced work-in-progress (WIP), and short schedules.
Are you struggling with user stories, epics, traditional requirements, estimation, and
dependencies? We can help you identify *thin vertical slices* of customer value work.

## Team Self Designing Workshop

It's very likely that your teams are structured in ways that cause wasteful *asynchronous dependencies*. We encourage
teams to design and reorganize themselves. But doing this without a structured workshop can just lead to people grouping
with where they're currently comfortable rather than where they'll learn the most and be the most effective.

----

## Current Architecture Workshop

You have legacy code that only a handful of people understand. This is an expensive and risky bottleneck. We
use the *current architecture workshop* to spread knowledge amongst more teams. This can reduce handoff delays
and the risk of introducing unintended regression failures.

----

## Mob Programming Facilitation

Your developers spend a surprising amount of time being stuck, or sawing away with tools they don't know need sharpening. 
A learning technique that's especially useful is to have a small group of developers sit together and all focus on the same programming 
problems at the same time. This spreads knowledge and skills very rapidly. Consider the possibility that software 
development is actually *knowledge creation*, not conventional manufacturing or construction.

----

## Code Smells Workshop

Even a child can write code that works.  But the real costs of the software aren't in the initial creation.  It takes 
decades to master the craft of well designed code (and tests) that reduce the long term costs. In the crush of meeting
short-term deadlines, developers working alone typically develop bad habits that seem normal to them.
In the *code smells workshop*, participants learn to identify up to a dozen harmful patterns in real code, and of
course how to prevent them.

## De-scaling Consultation

Lots of people are talking about "scaling Agile" and even selling hideous ways of doing it (e.g. SAFe, Scrum@Scale).  Let's
talk about *descaling organizational complexity* instead.

## Open Space (Large Group) Facilitation

Keep your company conference from being a waste of time.  We facilitate Harrison Owen-style Open Space gatherings
that increase the communication and camaraderie your organization needs to work toward a shared purpose.
