> Hi Michael - Your post caught my eye since I've been wrestling with the challenge of how to improve the agile operations of a couple of our teams. They've had a hard time adopting best practices, so my thoughts went to agile coaching. I took a course with you a number of years ago and got a ton out of it, so I value your opinion. If agile coaching is a fool's errand, what would you suggest?

I just spoke to a couple managers who see the need to modernize their organization, and whose CEO is skeptical of "Agile coaches."  In my opinion they are both right.

There's a reason I haven't called myself an Agile coach for years.
