excerpt: "Routine expertise has been or will be automated by AIs.  What does this mean for your existing job titles and org chart?"

## The end of the road for "experts"?

As of 2023, companies hire job titles such as "full stack" web developer, mobile application
developer, data scientist, UI/UX (user interface, user experience) designer, database designer,
DevOps engineer, business analyst, and a similar array of managers for these functions.  People 
spend years becoming experts in these areas.  I can still remember how insulted I felt as a young
server-side developer the first time a manager asked me to do a client-side development task

Let's call the application of previously-learned knowledge and skills *routine expertise*.

I hope I am not the first to tell you that machines are rapidly gaining the ability to apply
routine expertise.  Routine expertise will be (or has already been) automated by generative
AI and Language Learning Models.  Job titles like the ones I listed above will be 
obsolete in 3-5 years.  They will continue to exist in uncompetitive organizations.

## What can't machines do?

Training ChatGPT is energy and computationally intensive, plus the human 
effort required.  For now, humans are better at learning and adapting than machines are.   

A human may be more able to defy convention.  For instance, while a language model might 
suggest UI/UX designs based on historical data, a human might invent a novel solution that 
breaks conventions.  

For that matter, conventional wisdom is sometimes wrong or limiting, requiring the insight
of a nonconformist human.  And the trainers themselves have biases.  If ChatGPT had been trained on the prevailing orthodoxy of Copernicus's day, it would have said that the Earth was the center of the universe.

We'll call all this *learning expertise* to distinguish it from routine expertise.  

## What does GLAD stand for?

Craig Larman has proposed the acronym GLAD to stand for Generative AI LLM (Language Learning Model)
Assisted Development.  (I guess GAILLMAD contains more capital letters than he can stand.)  Craig describes himself as a junior GLAD developer.

## What will work look like in the future ?

From *The New New Product Development Game* by Takeuchi and Nonaka (1986):

> Under the rugby approach, the product development process emerges from the constant 
> interaction of a hand-picked, multidisciplinary team whose members work together from 
> start to finish.

With a focus on *learning expertise*, a small team of product developers will move from 
problem to problem much faster than your lumbering overstaffed departments do it today.
In LeSS we have always emphasized multi-learning to eliminate queuing and handoffs.
Soon the economics of this will be unavoidable.  A team that's serious about learning
will also try mob programming.

Organizational designs (structures and policies) will have to be simplified
to adapt to more complex work.

Will these super-teams do 15 minute daily meetings and estimate work in Fibonacci numbers?  
I hope not! But the *spirit* of Scrum described by Takeuchi and Nonaka will live on.
